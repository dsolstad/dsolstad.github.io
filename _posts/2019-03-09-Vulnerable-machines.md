After doing the Offensive Security courses PWK and CTP I felt an urge to create vulnerable machines myself, but I wanted to make them a little more modern. So in the last couple of months I have created some machines for you all to have a go at. They are in the beginner to intermediate difficulty range, some servers and some clients. It has been a real pain to make some of them and I have spent many hours, but I have learned a lot in the process. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I hated/loved making them!
  
All the machines have names from a particular TV show and the machines somewhat share the personalities with the characters in that show. 
  
The machines can be found here <a href="http://isz.no/vm">http://isz.no/vm</a> or here <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/series/sp,189/">https://www.vulnhub.com/series/sp,189/</a>
  
Lastly, I want to give the awesome people at VulnHub a shout-out for hosting the machines!
